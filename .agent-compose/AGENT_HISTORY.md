## implementer/hotkey-modal — 2026-03-25T15:00:00Z
- **Items completed**: t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, q1, q2, q3, q4
- **Tests run**: no — no test suite exists; verified server serves updated files via curl
- **Outcome**: success

## simplifier — 2026-03-25T15:10:00Z
- **Summary**: Simplified toggleHotkeyModal to use classList.toggle with force parameter instead of if/else; replaced anonymous close-button handler with direct function reference, removing a redundant guard check.
- **Tests run**: no — no test suite exists
- **Outcome**: success

## reviewer — 2026-03-25T15:20:00Z
- **Summary**: issues fixed — quoting style inconsistency (single quotes → double quotes to match codebase convention)
- **quality_checklist**: 4 items verified (q1, q2, q3, q4 — all pass)
- **Reviews**: code quality (2 issues: 1 fixed, 1 not actionable — overlay already blocks pointer input), error handling (clean), test coverage (adequate — no test infra project-wide)
- **Outcome**: success / exit_signal: true

## implementer/main — 2026-03-25T16:30:00Z
- **Items completed**: t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6
- **Tests run**: no — no automated test suite; verified server serves updated files via curl; grep confirmed no state.unit references remain
- **Outcome**: success

## simplifier — 2026-03-25T17:00:00Z
- **Summary**: Extracted three shared helpers (refreshView, isInBounds, canUnitHarvest) to eliminate duplicated logic; removed unnecessary null-check on rocktimusBtn element for consistency with other button references.
- **Tests run**: no — no automated test suite exists
- **Outcome**: success

## reviewer — 2026-03-25T17:30:00Z
- **Summary**: issues fixed — selectedUnit index drift during degradation (logic bug), gatherResource hardcoded "rocks" instead of using generalized resource type
- **quality_checklist**: 6 items verified (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 — all pass)
- **Reviews**: code quality (3 issues: 2 fixed, 1 deferred — render dispatch fallthrough is low-impact for 2-type game), error handling (clean), test coverage (adequate — no test infra project-wide)
- **Outcome**: success / exit_signal: true

## conflict-resolver — 2026-03-25T16:49:00Z

- **Conflict**: game.js (8 conflict regions) and style.css (1 conflict region) — upstream added Dust Storm feature (single-unit model with state.unit + state.robots), branch added multi-unit architecture (state.units[], UNIT_TYPES, createUnit, Rocktimus as unit)
- **Resolution**: Merged both features: kept multi-unit architecture (state.units[], getSelectedUnit, UNIT_TYPES, createUnit) from branch; kept full dust storm system (config, rendering, spawning, movement, collision) from upstream; adapted checkDustStormCollisions to iterate state.units instead of state.unit + state.robots; merged CSS to include storm, construct, and degrade log entry styles
- **Tests run**: none found — no automated test suite exists
- **Outcome**: success

## conflict-resolver — 2026-03-25T17:02:04Z

- **Conflict**: game.js (4 conflict regions), index.html (2 conflict regions), style.css (1 conflict region) — upstream added Subpar Battery feature (using state.unit single-unit model), branch had multi-unit architecture (state.units[], getSelectedUnit)
- **Resolution**: Kept both features — Subpar Battery (canBuildSubparBattery, buildSubparBattery, processSubparBatteryExplosions, UI button, "t" hotkey) adapted to use getSelectedUnit() instead of state.unit; Rocktimus (canBuildRocktimus, buildRocktimus, Tab cycling, "r" hotkey) kept as-is; merged CSS to include explosion, construct, and degrade log entry styles; merged HTML to include both battery and rocktimus buttons and hotkey entries; merged endTurn to call both processSubparBatteryExplosions and processUnitDegradation; game-over guards added to all button click handlers
- **Tests run**: none found — no automated test suite exists
- **Outcome**: success

## simplifier — 2026-03-25T19:45:00Z
- **Summary**: Reviewed Call Earth action and Mars Throne construction code — no meaningful simplifications found; code follows existing codebase conventions (guard-chain canX/buildX pattern, draw function structure, UI button/hotkey wiring)
- **Tests run**: yes — node --check game.js passed (syntax valid)
- **Outcome**: nothing to simplify

## reviewer — 2026-03-25T20:00:00Z
- **Summary**: clean — no critical issues found across code quality, error handling, and test coverage
- **quality_checklist**: 5 items verified (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5 — all pass)
- **Reviews**: code quality (clean — all 8 acceptance criteria satisfied, conventions followed), error handling (clean — synchronous codebase, guard clauses consistent), test coverage (adequate — no test infra project-wide, consistent with all prior features)
- **Outcome**: success / exit_signal: true

## conflict-resolver — 2026-03-25T19:37:47Z

- **Conflict**: game.js (4 conflict regions), index.html (2 conflict regions) — upstream added Call Earth dialog features (commDishesUsedThisTurn, callEarthDialogOpen, close-call-earth-dialog listener, 📡 emoji on button), branch added Mars Throne feature (marsThronePlaced state, build-throne-btn UI/listener/hotkey, canBuildMarsThrone)
- **Resolution**: Kept both features — merged state properties (commDishesUsedThisTurn + callEarthDialogOpen from HEAD, marsThronePlaced from incoming); kept Call Earth button with 📡 emoji from HEAD; added Mars Throne button, listener, hotkey entry, and updateUI block from incoming; kept close-call-earth-dialog listener from HEAD alongside build-throne-btn listener
- **Tests run**: none found — no automated test suite exists
- **Outcome**: success

## conflict-resolver — 2026-03-25T19:46:28Z

- **Conflict**: index.html (1 conflict region) — upstream added no-actions-msg div, branch had build-throne-btn button; .agent-compose/ files had agent artifact conflicts
- **Resolution**: Kept both — added build-throne-btn before no-actions-msg div in index.html; accepted theirs for agent artifact files; game.js and style.css auto-merged cleanly
- **Tests run**: none found — no automated test suite exists
- **Outcome**: success

## simplifier — 2026-03-25T22:30:00Z
- **Summary**: Extracted `deductHovelEnergy(amount)` helper to eliminate duplicated energy-deduction-across-hovels loop in `buildCommDish` and `buildGreenhouse`; consistent variable naming (`remaining` instead of mixed `energyToSpend`/`energyNeeded`)
- **Tests run**: yes — node --check game.js passed (syntax valid)

- **Conflict**: .agent-compose/current (agent artifact), .agent-compose/AGENT_HISTORY.md (agent artifact) — no code file conflicts
- **Resolution**: Accepted theirs for both agent artifact files; no code changes needed
- **Tests run**: none — no code conflicts, skipped per instructions
