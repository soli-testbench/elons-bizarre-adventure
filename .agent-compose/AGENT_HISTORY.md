## implementer/hotkey-modal — 2026-03-25T15:00:00Z
- **Items completed**: t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, q1, q2, q3, q4
- **Tests run**: no — no test suite exists; verified server serves updated files via curl
- **Outcome**: success

## simplifier — 2026-03-25T15:10:00Z
- **Summary**: Simplified toggleHotkeyModal to use classList.toggle with force parameter instead of if/else; replaced anonymous close-button handler with direct function reference, removing a redundant guard check.
- **Tests run**: no — no test suite exists
- **Outcome**: success

## reviewer — 2026-03-25T15:20:00Z
- **Summary**: issues fixed — quoting style inconsistency (single quotes → double quotes to match codebase convention)
- **quality_checklist**: 4 items verified (q1, q2, q3, q4 — all pass)
- **Reviews**: code quality (2 issues: 1 fixed, 1 not actionable — overlay already blocks pointer input), error handling (clean), test coverage (adequate — no test infra project-wide)
- **Outcome**: success / exit_signal: true

## implementer/main — 2026-03-25T16:30:00Z
- **Items completed**: t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10, t11, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6
- **Tests run**: no — no automated test suite; verified server serves updated files via curl; grep confirmed no state.unit references remain
- **Outcome**: success

## simplifier — 2026-03-25T17:00:00Z
- **Summary**: Extracted three shared helpers (refreshView, isInBounds, canUnitHarvest) to eliminate duplicated logic; removed unnecessary null-check on rocktimusBtn element for consistency with other button references.
- **Tests run**: no — no automated test suite exists
- **Outcome**: success

## reviewer — 2026-03-25T17:30:00Z
- **Summary**: issues fixed — selectedUnit index drift during degradation (logic bug), gatherResource hardcoded "rocks" instead of using generalized resource type
- **quality_checklist**: 6 items verified (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 — all pass)
- **Reviews**: code quality (3 issues: 2 fixed, 1 deferred — render dispatch fallthrough is low-impact for 2-type game), error handling (clean), test coverage (adequate — no test infra project-wide)
- **Outcome**: success / exit_signal: true

## conflict-resolver — 2026-03-25T16:49:00Z

- **Conflict**: game.js (8 conflict regions) and style.css (1 conflict region) — upstream added Dust Storm feature (single-unit model with state.unit + state.robots), branch added multi-unit architecture (state.units[], UNIT_TYPES, createUnit, Rocktimus as unit)
- **Resolution**: Merged both features: kept multi-unit architecture (state.units[], getSelectedUnit, UNIT_TYPES, createUnit) from branch; kept full dust storm system (config, rendering, spawning, movement, collision) from upstream; adapted checkDustStormCollisions to iterate state.units instead of state.unit + state.robots; merged CSS to include storm, construct, and degrade log entry styles
- **Tests run**: none found — no automated test suite exists
- **Outcome**: success

## conflict-resolver — 2026-03-25T17:02:04Z

- **Conflict**: game.js (4 conflict regions), index.html (2 conflict regions), style.css (1 conflict region) — upstream added Subpar Battery feature (using state.unit single-unit model), branch had multi-unit architecture (state.units[], getSelectedUnit)
- **Resolution**: Kept both features — Subpar Battery (canBuildSubparBattery, buildSubparBattery, processSubparBatteryExplosions, UI button, "t" hotkey) adapted to use getSelectedUnit() instead of state.unit; Rocktimus (canBuildRocktimus, buildRocktimus, Tab cycling, "r" hotkey) kept as-is; merged CSS to include explosion, construct, and degrade log entry styles; merged HTML to include both battery and rocktimus buttons and hotkey entries; merged endTurn to call both processSubparBatteryExplosions and processUnitDegradation; game-over guards added to all button click handlers
- **Tests run**: none found — no automated test suite exists
- **Outcome**: success

## implementer/main — 2026-03-25T18:41:00Z
- **Items completed**: t1, t2, q1
- **Tests run**: yes — docker build succeeded, container responded HTTP 200 on port 8080
- **Outcome**: success

## implementer/main — 2026-03-25T19:21:00Z
- **Items completed**: t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, q1, q2, q3, q4
- **Tests run**: yes — verified server serves updated files via curl (HTTP 200, all 3 files confirmed)
- **Outcome**: success

## simplifier — 2026-03-25T19:45:00Z
- **Summary**: Consolidated 6 repeated button show/hide/disable blocks in updateUI() into a data-driven array + loop, reducing 38 lines to 18 while preserving identical behavior.
- **Tests run**: no — no automated test suite exists; verified JS syntax with node --check
- **Outcome**: success

## reviewer — 2026-03-25T20:00:00Z
- **Summary**: clean — no critical issues found across code quality, error handling, and test coverage
- **quality_checklist**: 4 items verified (q1, q2, q3, q4 — all pass)
- **Reviews**: code quality (1 issue investigated: AC3 movesLeft concern is spec wording imprecision, not a code bug — gatherResource() is a free action that doesn't consume moves), error handling (clean), test coverage (adequate — no test infra project-wide)
- **Outcome**: success / exit_signal: true

## conflict-resolver — 2026-03-25T19:37:50Z

- **Conflict**: index.html (1 conflict region) — upstream added "Call Earth" button, branch added "no-actions-msg" div
- **Resolution**: Kept both additions — "Call Earth" button and "no-actions-msg" div placed sequentially in the actions panel
- **Tests run**: none found — no automated test suite exists
- **Outcome**: success
